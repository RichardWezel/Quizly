Hello my friend and friend something I do quite often is create gradients with a single color stop in them And why would I do that gradients are all about interpolating from one color to another we want something that looks pretty So why would I make a gradient with a single color? That's a really good question. So today we're gonna answer that by diving into this demo here where I have We're gonna look at a couple of different things and use cases But here's one of them where I have text that's hard to read because my background images light and dark and this happens all the time And so instead of using a pseudo element or something else to try and you know create an overlay I can just do it with a second gradient or a second image and images happen to be gradients So I can do a linear gradient here and it could be any gradient conic radio whatever you want conic would actually save you a a keystroke here And I just have to comma separate them. So I do my linear gradient comma and then I have my URL and the linear gradient needs to be first So this is on top of this one. That's the way they will layer And I could just come here and actually write black and hit save and now I have a solid black color on top Which is completely useless But we could maybe use a black with a lower opacity. So we'll use an hsl of 0 0% 0% and I'll put like a point five for the alpha value and then as we can see if we go with a zero here It's quite hard to read this text and if I come in with a point five now I can actually read all of my text and you can adjust this alpha However Fits for the image and the situation you're in and I'm using black Maybe you'd want to come in with a different color something that's a bit more on brand with the greens here and use a blend mode or something like that Really depends on the situation that you're in but that would open up that possibility as well Now there is one small thing with this is a single color gradient like this is supported in all browsers But chrome was actually the last one to add it and support for it isn't perfect It's relatively new So if you do want to ensure that you have farther back support You can just come here and put a zero zero which it looks really weird But this will help with just having better browser support because what these are the two color stops that we're putting for this gradient And the reason this works with two color stops is let's just come here and do a red comma We're going to keep that one there and then we'll put another red after this Just so we can see what this is doing and instead of a zero zero here I'm going to say this is like a 20% 50% and so now we have the red into this semi-transparent black color that goes from 20% to 50% and then it transitions back to red So the two color stops here are what are you know making this work and if I do a zero zero It makes it valid and then I can get rid of both of those so again On necessary maybe you're watching this in the future you might not need to bother with this right now I would include this just to make sure that my browser support is is decent And this is probably the most common use case I use it for except today Are more modern stuff? We're doing where things like gradient borders are all the rage and so let's take a look at my button That I have right here where there's my button and I have my hover on here We're going to add a little animation to it afterwards But let's start with just the button where I'm actually going to change my border to start with and the border I'm going to make it I'm going to exaggerate because it's a demo So we're going to save five pixels solid but the trick here is to make it transparent And this might seem a little bit strange, but we're going to start there And then for my background here I am actually going to stick with the background shorthand Almost every time I use background property I actually use the long hand but using the shorthand here does help out And I would never get me in trouble for the type of thing I'm doing here So instead of white I'm going to do a linear gradient of white Which you know that gives us the exact same thing as we saw so I've hit save it looks exactly the same Though it did get a bit bigger just because I have the border that's on there now And then I'm going to do a comma and we're going to come in with another gradient In this case I'm going to come in with a conic gradient And let's just do something like a blue to purple and then back to blue And we don't see it But that's kind of stupid right if I turn this off let's you know remove this line Now we can see my conic gradient is there and you'll notice something a little bit weird about it In that the top and the bottom area have like a weird repeat going on And that's because gradients will fill up the content box or the padding box I should say And then they repeat underneath the border because normally your border is visible You don't you don't have a transparent border So it's giving it it has this it's like a weird thing with gradients But it makes sense most of the time Just so you actually see your entire gradient if you happen to have a border In this case though I want my conic gradient to fill in that space and I don't want this weird thing happening So I can actually come here and say this should be in my border box And this is why I'm using the Shorthand of background because this is actually doing two different things This is going to set both the Background clip and the background origin to border box And if we come and take a look when I hit save on here Now you can see that conic gradient is filling up all the way into that space Which is exactly what I want then if I turn this white back on and hit save I'm going to come on here and I'm going to say this should only be inside my padding box Then it pulls that back in and we only have the gradient on the outside and the single color here And again, I am doing it without the 0 0 here you can add that for better browser support Uh, but then we get that going on and we have a gradient border And I always get questions when I do this of why am I doing it with a Gradient like this instead of just using a border image And the reason for that is if you want to have a border radius Which I think it looks kind of cool with the border radius on there If you're using a border image then you can't get that to work So, uh, you know Now I can actually have my my border radius and a nice little bonus tip here I guess if you do 100 VW you'll always get a pill shape So let's do that here. I did purple. Let's do this is red just so it stands out a little bit more And as a little bonus this is nothing to do with the color stops But we can get a nice little animation and I did a short on this where somebody suggested way to improve the animations We're going to see that on a much better way we can animate it So you can see here I do have an animation that doesn't exist yet So I'm going to do that at keyframes of rotate But that does question like what are we rotating? What are we moving? And for me it would be the easiest thing to do is the angle we have on here And normally on backgrounds we can't do any sorts of transitions or animations But now we can do an at property which now is in all browsers So I'm going to do an at property of angle Call it whatever we need And so the syntax of this and if you haven't seen this before This is called a registered custom property So this will be an angle And with the registered custom properties it's It's sort of like we're like TypeScript We're saying what this custom property is Which enables us to be able to animate the values of custom properties So the syntax is angle the initial value I'm going to use turns so I'm going to say it could be degree whatever degrees is fine We're going to use a turn after though where it says zero degrees And then we're going to come here and say that the inherits Inherits I'm going to put true It's up to you it doesn't really matter but I'm going to say it's true And then we're going to come actually before we come down I just saw I have a small mistake here where my angle needs to have It's a custom property so we have to start it with the double-hyphen And then I'll come down here and we're going to say this is my From because kind of gradients needed a from of our angle And now everything looks the same but say I change this to 180 degrees The red will go on top instead So it's using the value here as what we have here But then on my rotate here what we can do now is we can say this is two And we want our angle to go to one turn And so this is where we're actually changing the value of the custom property By first registering that custom property And now when I go on top of it you can see that it's rotating around Now there is a small problem is when I come off It just jumps and this is where the the commenter helped me out In giving me a better idea And full credit to you I don't have your name on hand but I'll put a screenshot up So I just want to say thank you very much for this suggestion Of instead of doing that what we're going to do is actually have this animation always on Right here so now it's always rotating and that's kind of annoying Then it's always rotating Right we don't want it to happen we well hopefully not Especially at this speed if you're going to do something like this make it a lot slower than what we're doing here Because it's kind of annoying that it moves that fast But ideally it would only be when we hover So then what we can actually say is the animation play state is paused Is it paused or paused it is paused okay And then when we hover the animation play state is running And it looks the same but now if we go on top it moves But if I come off it pauses but the nice thing with that is it means it doesn't jump It stops wherever it is when we come off So a little bonus tip made the video a bit longer But I hope you like that and appreciate the little bonus tip right there And whether you did or not I really do hope that you enjoyed this video though I would really appreciate it if you hit the sub button if you haven't yet subscribed I have it with that I do want to thank my neighbor of awesome Johnny as well as all my other patrons and channel members for their monthly support And of course until next time don't forget to make your corner of the internet Just a little bit more awesome
